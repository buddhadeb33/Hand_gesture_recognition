# Real Time Hand gesture recognition with Tesorflow & OpenCV
The ability to perceive the shape and motion of hands can be a vital component in improving the user experience across a variety of technological domains and platforms. For example, it can form the basis for sign language understanding and hand gesture control, and can also enable the overlay of digital content and information on top of the physical world in augmented reality. While coming naturally to people, robust real-time hand perception is a decidedly challenging computer vision task, as hands often occlude themselves or each other (e.g. finger/palm occlusions and hand shakes) and lack high contrast patterns.


Features : Support maximum two hands

## **<font style="color:rgb(134,19,348)">Perform Hands Landmarks Detection</font>**


In the step, we will create a function **`detectHandsLandmarks()`** that will take an image/frame as input and will perform the landmarks detection on the hands in the image/frame using the solution provided by Mediapipe and will get **twenty-one 3D landmarks** for each hand in the image. The function will display or return the results depending upon the passed arguments.
